# Partial-Differential-Equation-for-equatorial-momentum-equations-in-Matlab
This project presents the idea how to estimate the unbalanced equatorial surface currents via partial differential equation, and provides a Matlab code for solving the equation. The data used are attached at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l9e3yiwRHSnyFHNJsz-Sxg7204cvXaQR?usp=sharing for public download.
The whole Matlab code was completed by Dr. Minyang Wang in 2019, when he visited San Diego (USA), and worked with Prof. Shang-Ping Xie, Prof. Samuel Shen and Prof. Du.
